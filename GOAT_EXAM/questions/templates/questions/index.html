        - What is the GOAT?: The G.O.A.T. (Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test) 
        is a Vault-Tec occupational assessment test that every resident of a vault 
        is required to take at the age of 16. Your answers are used to determine
        which occupation in the vault you will fit best in. Good luck!
